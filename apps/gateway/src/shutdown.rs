//! Graceful shutdown: the signal, and the drain it starts.
//!
//! The gateway is PID 1 in its container, and Linux discards a signal whose
//! disposition is still the default for PID 1 — so without the handler
//! installed here, SIGTERM does nothing at all and every deploy ends in a
//! SIGKILL after the orchestrator's stop timeout. Installing it is what makes
//! shutdown possible; the rest of this module is what makes it graceful.
//!
//! Three pieces:
//!
//! - a **signal**, broadcast to every connection so it can stop taking new work
//!   while finishing what it has;
//! - a **guard**, held by each task the drain must wait for;
//! - a **deadline**, because some of what this proxy carries is an indefinite
//!   byte pipe that can never "finish" on its own.
//!
//! Nothing here costs anything per request: a connection subscribes once when
//! it is accepted, and the guard is one atomic upgrade at the same moment.
