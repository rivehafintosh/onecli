/**
 * The OAuth callback's redirect origin when the API and the dashboard are
 * served on **different hosts**.
 *
 * A deployment can run this API package standalone — answering on an API host
 * and declaring it via the `selfUrl` option — while the dashboard pages are
 * served elsewhere. CLI and SDK clients talk to the API host, so a browser can
 * arrive at this callback there; but `/app-connect/*` is a Next.js page that
 * only exists on the dashboard host. The last redirect therefore has to cross
 * origins, which it can only do from a configured `APP_URL`.
 *
 * This lives in its own file because the edition (and so `IS_CLOUD`) is read at
 * module load, and the sibling `apps.test.ts` pins `onprem-slim` for the
 * single-host cases. Nothing here is mocked — the real resolution path runs,
 * which is what makes it a trustworthy guard.
