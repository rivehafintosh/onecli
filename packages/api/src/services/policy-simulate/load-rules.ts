// ignores `enabled`, and returns DTOs): enabled rules only, Default Rules
// INCLUDED (they drive the deny-default terminal), published pinned to the
// active max generation. Only PERSISTED default rows load — the gateway knows
// nothing of the API's "virtual default" display concept, and a missing default
// is exactly "this level contributes no verdict" under the uniform law.
//
// The gateway reads the set TWICE for two different questions, and so does
// this module — see the two exports at the bottom:
//   - DECISION (`assemble_v2`)   → `equipment` rows DROPPED. They inject a
//     credential without permitting its host, so letting one into the decision
//     set would silently allow traffic nothing granted.
//   - INJECTION (`inject_select`) → `equipment` rows KEPT. They are what a
//     selective agent's credentials are actually made of.
// Asking one question of the other set is the bug this split exists to make
// impossible; every caller must name which it wants.
