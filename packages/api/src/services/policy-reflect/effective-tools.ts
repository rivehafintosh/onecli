// The per-tool "effective permissions" reflection behind the App
// Permissions panel (step 9.7b): what the ENFORCED (published) v2 rules decide
// for each catalog tool of a provider, computed with the same engine, inputs,
// and two-level composition the gateway uses. Per tool, every catalog
// path×method variant is synthesized into a concrete request (see
// `synthesizePath`) and run through `evaluatePolicyOutcome`; the variants
// aggregate into one verdict, or `mixed` when they disagree. Read-only — the
// panel's editing moved to the Policy console.
//
// HONESTY NOTES (deliberate, documented):
// - A rule targeting a CONCRETE sub-path narrower than a tool's pattern is not
//   visible to a representative request (it would need pattern-intersection
//   analysis) — the same inherent limit as any per-tool summary.
// - Body conditions cannot be exercised (no body input) — conditioned rules
//   that would match live cannot match here, an inherent limit of any static
//   summary.
// - `hasInjections` is DERIVED per tool host from the agent's credential pools
//   (the injection-probe approximation, hoisted once per request); the response
//   discloses whether a credential is attached so a "Not managed" wall on an
//   unconnected app reads correctly.
//
// REDACTION CONTRACT (this file is its canonical home): org rule
// DETAILS are org-admin-only; a non-admin sees `redacted: true` provenance and
// org rules are excluded from the `variesByIdentity` disclosure count.
// `orgResources` deliberately discloses the org rule's repo/folder VALUES —
// never the rule's name or identity — to project viewers: the same posture as
// the rate-limit values above, and for GitHub the repo list is already visible
// via the connection's own metadata.
//
// RESPONSE CONSTRAINT: tool endpoint mappings (hostPattern/pathPattern/method)
// NEVER serialize — per-tool id + verdict + provenance only (the client-safe
// summary already carries names/descriptions; the leak is pinned by test).
